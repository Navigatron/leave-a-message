# [leave-a-message](https://navigatron.github.io/leave-a-message/) :telephone_receiver:

A little text field to leave a message in!

At first, you'll see the message left by the last visitor. If you'd like, you can replace it with your own message. It will be stored (thanks to [MyJson](https://myjson.com/api)) and shown to the next visitor.

### Try it out

You can see or change the message by clicking this link:

### Challenge: 15 minutes to MVP :tada:

At first, my goal was to see if I could build this in 15 minutes. I got close! I had to take an extra 10 minutes (for debugging) in order to achieve functionality.

**Total time**: 25 minutes.

After the challenge was over, I cleaned the JS and added some CSS to make it look pretty.
