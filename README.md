Goal: In 15 minutes, write a proof-of-concept for a public JSON API.

Did I succeed? Not quite. I needed another 10 minutes to diagnose a bug - I needed
to `JSON.stringify` the payload before sending it.

Total time: 25 minutes.

Since reaching MVP, a few more changes have been made. I added some CSS and cleaned the JS a tad.
